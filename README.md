#My Acient Cities App
##Introduction
It's impossible to travel back in time to experience the lives of early humans, but it is possible to visit where they made their homes. The oldest cities in the world boast beautiful architecture and ancient artifacts that demonstrate the skill of human ancestors.
I selected some ancient cities to introduce my App. These cities saw the dawn of human civilization and are still thriving today. Visiting the world's oldest cities can give people an insight into both the past and future.
My Ancient is an app used to record ancient city. It is a useful tool to information about human history.

This is an app that I had in mind when I first started programming. I thought it would be a good idea to create an app for this instead.

This repo is for the front-end of the app. I used React to build the user interface and created React Routers for navgigating through the different components of the app.


##Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
MongoDB, Express, React, Node
Axios, Bulma, Mongoose
